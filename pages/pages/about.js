            What is Pumpa Token?
          </h1>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            Pumpa Token is more than a meme coin â€” it's a creative ecosystem combining crypto, anime, and gaming.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            The project was born from a dream: giving one last chance to the underdogs of the crypto world. It began with anime videos, emotional stories, and now aims to expand into web-based adventure games, NFT characters, and even a full anime series.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            Our vision is to build a fun, emotional and community-powered crypto universe. 
            With every token, you support storytelling, game development and a growing anime ecosystem.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg font-semibold mt-8">
            Join us. Be a part of the Pumpa journey.
